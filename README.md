🚀 Blood Pressure Prediction using AI This project uses a simple Linear Regression model to predict blood pressure based on simulated health features such as age and weight. The model is developed and run in Google Colab, making it easy to experiment, visualize, and share.

🔧 Features Built using scikit-learn and Matplotlib

Predicts blood pressure from health-related input features

Visualizes model performance with a True vs. Predicted BP plot 📊

Easily extendable to work with real-world data

📁 Technologies Used Python 🐍

Google Colab 💻

scikit-learn 🤖

NumPy & Matplotlib 📈

💡 Future Work Integrate real clinical data for training

Explore advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks)

Add performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
